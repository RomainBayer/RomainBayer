Hi! My name is Romain Bayer.

I am a gamedeveloper who loves prototyping, level design and programming.

While I mainly work on Unity and Unreal, I am alway open to learn new environments. 
Like recently I learned to use SDL2 with OpenGL to generate a playable Shogi game in 3D!

Currently I am developing an unannounced RPG.
